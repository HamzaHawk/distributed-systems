### 1. Pthreads
`DPP.c`: A naive dining philosophers solver. For a robust and lock-free one, see my repo [Dining-Philosophers](https://github.com/irsisyphus/Dining-Philosophers)

`Sobel.cpp`: Sobel filter in pthreads.

### 2. OpenMPI
`WordCnt.cpp`: Count frequency of a word in a file in OpenMPI.

`Sobel.cpp`: Sobel filter in OpenMPI.

### 3. OpenMP

`Sobel.cpp`: Sobel filter in OpenMP, supports static and dynamic scheduling.
